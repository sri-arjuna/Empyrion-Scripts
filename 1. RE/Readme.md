RE - Reforged Eden 1.8.5
========================

This is a storage space for scripts I've written.

It is also a split up between language and my own builds (DSEV, english) and the faction I play on the server (DGW, german).

While I try to just put 'invidivual' scripts in these directories, the more complex ones, like "Sorting" are split up due to different naming of containers due to different prefixes for the used language (like: IO-\* for Ingots/Ores is EB-\* for Erze/Barren).

This said, obviously scripts that need/ed specific adjustments for their builds are stored in here, such as the Harvest scripts due to their coordination values.
