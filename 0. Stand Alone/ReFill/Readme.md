Re Fill
=======

These scripts refill either tanks (ReFuel\*) or boxes.

While the **ReFuel** script should take items only out of one box (remove the other listed box names for Bases or CV Carriers), the ReFill scripts for the input box and food/medic production, should check everything on the base and move a certain amount into their according constructor/processor input.
