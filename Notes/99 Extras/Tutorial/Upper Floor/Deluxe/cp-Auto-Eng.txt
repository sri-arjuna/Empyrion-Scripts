As you had read in the tutorial, we can work with device names, which we will do here.

In this script we are looking for device that start with "i-, Deco-, c-" (container), we then look for devices with the same name, but have an "x" at the end, which will be their according LCD.
When we have found these, we are reading the contents of the container and display it on the LCD.

<color=red>Attention:</color> Contrainer Controller are different, this only works with 'regular' containers.

I have got more examples of "Label-Scripts" on Github, incl some with "Progressbar".<color=yellow>

The naming syntax is probably not the most intuitive one, but it is the preparation for the sorting scripts!

Syntax:
<prefix>-Description-ID

The prefix serves 2 purposes:
1. Sorted list in the devices menu (P) and F4 list.
2. When accessing more than 80 devices via script, all of the playfield starts to lag.


------------------------

Similar to the script on the right, but for Container Controller only.
This ones optimized for Mass/Volume oriented output, which is also why it requires 2 scripts.

For one part, because the original design by Sulusdacor almost fills a complete LCD on its own , at last after reading / printing "Name" and "Volume" the script reaches its character limit.
For another part, the progress bar itself must be rotated so it fullfills the purpose of the original design.

If you want to have content shown here, you must use a 3rd script, unless you want the list to scroll, in which case you will need 1 script per box.

<u><color=green>Script:BoxDisplay</color> = </u>
looks for devices named "<color=yellow>Box-</color>NAME", based on that results it searched for devices (LCD) that contain "NAME<color=green>_Display</color>", where NAME is a placeholder. NAME (without Box-) will then be shown as Name/Description of that box, as well as the volume it provides.

<u><color=green>Script:BoxBar</color> = </u>
Identical to Display, but searching for "NAME<color=green>_Bar</color>", which will then calculate how much the bar should be filled.

If you have multiple cargo and ammo boxes, you might want to create a new script and adjust the code to use the prefix "Ammo-" and then also change the caption "Cargo" to "Ammo" which is shown above the NAME.
