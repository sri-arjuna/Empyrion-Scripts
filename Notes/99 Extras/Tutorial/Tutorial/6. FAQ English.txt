The script does not work!?!

1. The Script-LCD name MUST BE exactly like this "Script:", saying, always start with a capital S!
2. The name of the script MUST BE <color=yellow>unique</color> sein
3. Boxes and fridges MUST NOT be named like the script, they must be <color=yellow>unique</color>.
4. <indent=15>Is there an error message on the output-LCD? 
<color=green>Yes</color> - Most likely, there are missing brackets {()}, or "follow" what is described in the error message, sorry does not apply always...
<color=red>No</color> - check 1-3</indent>

ID lists are very comfortable if you have to work with multiple items.

They contain the "Key" name of an item and return a list of IDs.
This works cross-servers!

Some servers occasionaly provide custom items, these 'mess up' the original ID list order, when working with the provided ID lists, this cannot happen.
Only custom items will not show up in these lists, obviously, but everything else that you expect of that list, will be there.

To show the content of such a list, you can use:
<color=green>
    {{@IDs.Ore}}
</color>

You can also combine the lists, either with other lists or specific ids:
<color=green>
    (concat Ids.WeaponHV Ids.WeaponSV Ids.WeaponCV)
    (concat '1234,5568' Ids.ArmorMod)
</color>
