Scripts are "short texts" (Empyrion limit this to 2000 characters), that are able to perform small tasks, as in, can execute little commands.

This can be almost anything, from a simple time display, basic player information, what contents are with cargo boxes, and heaps more.

As soon you are working with items (names), you should use <color=yellow>{{i18n key}}</color> so you can exchange your scripts with people galaxy wide!
This will allow people to simply translate item names to their prefered/used language by the use of the LCD "CultureInfo".
Read more in <color=yellow>Basics 2</color>.

The tutorial is designed so that white text is the <color=white>description</color>, green is for <color=green>code</color> and cyan is the <color=#00ffff>output</color>.
It is ment that you do edit and change <color=green>code LCDs</color>.
= Learning by doing!

---------------------------------

Yes, this might be quite a bunch of information for just Basics...

It is also so you can read it again when needed.

It is ment to give a rough overview, but will be explained later in detail!
