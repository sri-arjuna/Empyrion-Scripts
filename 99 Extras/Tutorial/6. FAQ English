The script does not work!?!

1. The Script-LCD name MUST BE exactly like this "Script:", saying, always start with a capital S!
2. The name of the script MUST BE <color=yellow>unique</color> sein
3. Boxes and fridges MUST NOT be named like the script, they must be <color=yellow>unique</color>.
4. <indent=15>Is there an error message on the output-LCD? 
<color=green>Yes</color> - Most likely, there are missing brackets {()}, or "follow" what is described in the error message, sorry does not apply always...
<color=red>No</color> - check 1-3</indent>
