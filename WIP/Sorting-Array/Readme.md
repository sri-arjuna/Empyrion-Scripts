This is an attempt to make an AIO-Sorting (All In One).
However, according to several experiments with different sorting methods - on rather awesome Empyrion servers, we'v encountered lags when working with 80-90 cargo boxes within a single script.

I do hope to bypass that situation with this attempt, but only time will tell.
