Each of these scripts will require special naming for both boxes and LCD.

Basicly, each name ***requires*** 3 dashes (-)!

Which is:
--------

1. Prefix
2. Description
3. Postfix / ID


This is a **must** as it also helps to prepare for sorting-scripts!

Both, LCD and BOX are named the same, but the LCD has a tailing (at the end) 'y'.

Nothing may ever have the exact same name, or scripts will not work, this is why we need to have that tailing 'y'.
