{
  "LanguageTag": "de-CH",
  "i18nDefault": "English",
  "UTCplusTimezone": 1
}
-- -------------------------
-- 1. The Language Tag basicly defines how numbers are displayed, for example 1000 becomes 1'000.
-- 2. The i18nDefault will automaticly translate (given Empyrion supports the language) to its given language.
--		Write your language in your language:
--			Language // How to write
--			English = English
--			German = Deutsch
--			French = Fran√ßais
-- 3. UTCplusTimezone defines the offset of your timezone.
--       Basicly, enter the number which reflects the difference between the time shown in the upper left next to the build number.
