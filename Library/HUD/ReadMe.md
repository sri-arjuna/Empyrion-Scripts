DSEV HUD
========

Deep Space Exploration Versatiles is proud to present you their HUD!

While it can work as a standalone script, it does come with a "module support".

Currently provided modules are:
* Ammo Containers (Bar, Content list)
* Cargo Containers (Bar)
* Harvest Containers (Bar)

By the simple use of wording the LCDs in a certain way, you can list them on the left side of the HUD!

Just name them: 

	Script:HUD_\*

For obvious reasons, it'll include them in numerical and alphabetical order, so everything after the lower dash starting with a "1" will be shown before a "z".

As the scripts are now, be aware to add the following:
* Script:[+11]HUD_2_Ammo
* Script:[+3]HUD_1_Cargo
* Script:[+3]HUD_1_Harvest
